# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll walk through [this tutorial](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html) and implement the code described. In particular, you'll get exposure to working with Linear Models, and intentionally nesting dataframes (i.e., dataframes where the columns contain dataframes).

In addition to implementing the code, you should make your own graphics (using a package of your choice), and consider some of the ways in which you can answer relevant / data-driven questions.
